# KVP tables

KVP tables are a way to represent key-value pairs in a table format.

ZIO Pravega provides a way to read and write KVP tables:

* from / to Pravega streams.
* from / to simple Scala collections.


Alternatively, you can use the zio.pravega.PravegaTable to open a KVP table and read / write to it.
